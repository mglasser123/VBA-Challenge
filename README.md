# VBA-Challenge
I used a starter code provided by the instructor to help me complete this challenge. I also received some help during office hours to debug some of my code that was not working properly.


Because the excel macro enabled worksheet was too large of a file to include in this repository, I included screenshots of the results of the first part of each worksheet as well as a text file with my code. I also have included the Alphabetical Testing file that was smaller where I initially ran my code for reference. This includes the exact same code I used on my final version.
